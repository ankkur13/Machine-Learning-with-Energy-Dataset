# Case: Machine Learning with Energy datasets

## Summary:
As interest in IOT and sensors pick up steam, companies are trying to build algorithms and systems to
understand consumer behavior to help them make better decisions. One such application is energy
modeling. Though, most consumers are aware of their aggregate consumption of energy, few are aware
of how and where energy is consumed. With increasing sensors in equipment, it is becoming easier to find
out which equipment/instruments consume the most power. AdaptiveAlgo Systems Inc. works on
solutions to build algorithms and platforms to address energy modeling challenges. The company is
putting together a solution for energy modeling and is interested in understanding consumer energy
usage and the attributes that contribute to appliance energy usage. The data scientists there came across
a recent paper and dataset and are interested in building various machine learning models that could
contribute to understanding energy usage by appliances and the attributes that contribute to aggregate
energy usage. With the knowledge of energy consumed by various equipment, seasonality and attributes
like temperature and humidity, a machine learning model could be used to predict aggregate energy use

## Introduction
> This case study is divided into eight parts, work of which is kept in it's respective directory.
> Following are the contents of the case study:

| Part | Description |
| :------| :-----------|
| Part 1: Research Paper Review | Review 3 papers and provide a Jupyter Notebook for each paper. |
| Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis | Conduct EDA using Python libraries (plotly, seaborn, matplotlib etc.). Provide a PowerPoint Report with graphs and key insights. |
| Part 3: Feature Engineering | Conduct thorough feature analysis and use pre-processing techniques to make the data usable. |
