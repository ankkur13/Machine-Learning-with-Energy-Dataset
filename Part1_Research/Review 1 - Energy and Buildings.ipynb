    "This section is too big and unwanted information is presented. Like, there are no use of house pictures in the article. Similarly, author introduced the work presented in each research paper they referred. The author wrote 3 pages for introduction. This should be brief and easy to understand.  And, also the author used abbreviation form but the full form is not given for eg. HVAC. It makes too difficult for the lay man to understand these terminologies.On a positive note,\n",

    "After introduction, the paper focussed on the house description, they considered various parameters such as floor area, ventilation, windows, no of occupants etc. In this section, the author used some variables like T1, T2, T3...and RH1, RH2, RH3...Instead of these variables, the author could use auto-descriptive variables which would be easy to understand. Again, the author used a picture of one wireless sensor which I think of no or little use here. On the other side, the author perfectly described the house and its appliances. They also considered all the floors in the house."

    "The span of dataset used for analysis is only 4.5 months. I am not agree with this, because if author used the weather predictors like atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind speed then author should gather at least one year of data in order to get the perfect result. Also the weather station is not near the house, it is 12 km far from the house. It means that the weather data collected may be vary and it could be different. On a positive side, author showed pairplot, boxplot, and correlation matrix to demonstrate the relationship among the predictors. "

    "Here, the author calculated the result with RMSE, R-square, MAE, MAPE for each one of the model and then considered the best prediction model based on the result of above calculations (lower RMSE and highest R-Square). In this section, the author breached  the consistency for eg.  the author mentioned R squared as R2 and R-Squared. This paper successfully achieved how to filter data to remove non-predictive parameters (feature selection)."

    "There are various limitations in this article such as the author considered only one house for the study. It could be better if the author used several houses' data for study. As mentioned earlier, the weather station is 12 km far from the house, the data will not be accurate to study. Other things should be keep in mind such as occupants age, no of occupants. To improve the energy prediction, the better sensors accuracy could help. Also, the optimal location of wireless indoor sensors is not mentioned. Also, the occupant's activity information and the measurement of CO2 by wireless sensors could be useful to improve the prediction. The weather data such as solar radiation and precipitation could also be considered. "
