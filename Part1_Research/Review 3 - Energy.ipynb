    "As the title of this paper implies, it is a prospective study for predicting the energy consumption of different appliances in homes using historical data for next day. Paper is very well prepared and the language used is appropriate with no major errors. Author has also tried to decsribe the idea of the study using various plots which makes it precise and easy to understand."

    "The objective for using wide range of methods is to come up with an optimal energy saving plan, but the data considered for prediction is only of 100 households of a specific region. I am not convinced with implementation of such method because of  features like temparature, wind strength, humidity which might not cause much variations to the energy saving plan as such plans cannot be implemented to other regions with different climatic conditions. But on the contrary author has come up with various plots and graphs whcih makes it easy to compare prediction results for various methods."

    "Here author has categorised predictors in an unrealistic way by considering the probablity of the predictor which comes to be 0 or 1. This approach is not feasible as to get a precise result each and every point of energy consumption of an appliance should be considered. Along with this the formulaic approach to express precision of the predictor is not well explained and cannot be undertsand by a layman.\n"

Also Obtaining different clusters for weekdays and weekends makes it more precise in terms of prediction whcih author has succesfully accomplished in this paper."
